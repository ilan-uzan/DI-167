# üåü Exercise 1: Cats
# Key Python Topics:

# Classes and objects
# Object instantiation
# Attributes
# Functions


# Instructions:

# Use the provided Cat class to create three cat objects. Then, create a function to find the oldest cat and print its details.



# Step 1: Create Cat Objects

# Use the Cat class to create three cat objects with different names and ages.


# Step 2: Create a Function to Find the Oldest Cat

# Create a function that takes the three cat objects as input.
# Inside the function, compare the ages of the cats to find the oldest one.
# Return the oldest cat object.


# Step 3: Print the Oldest Cat‚Äôs Details

# Call the function to get the oldest cat.
# Print a formatted string: ‚ÄúThe oldest cat is <cat_name>, and is <cat_age> years old.‚Äù
# Replace <cat_name> and <cat_age> with the oldest cat‚Äôs name and age.


# Example:

# class Cat:
#     def __init__(self, cat_name, cat_age):
#         self.name = cat_name
#         self.age = cat_age

# # Step 1: Create cat objects
# # cat1 = create the object

# # Step 2: Create a function to find the oldest cat
# def find_oldest_cat(cat1, cat2, cat3):
#     # ... code to find and return the oldest cat ...

# # Step 3: Print the oldest cat's details


# üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Goal: Create a Dog class, instantiate objects, call methods, and compare dog sizes.



# Key Python Topics:

# Classes and objects
# Object instantiation
# Methods
# Attributes
# Conditional statements (if)


# Instructions:

# Create a Dog class with methods for barking and jumping. Instantiate dog objects, call their methods, and compare their sizes.



# Step 1: Create the Dog Class

# Create a class called Dog.
# In the __init__ method, take name and height as parameters and create corresponding attributes.
# Create a bark() method that prints ‚Äú goes woof!‚Äù.
# Create a jump() method that prints ‚Äú jumps cm high!‚Äù, where x is height * 2.


# Step 2: Create Dog Objects

# Create davids_dog and sarahs_dog objects with their respective names and heights.


# Step 3: Print Dog Details and Call Methods

# Print the name and height of each dog.
# Call the bark() and jump() methods for each dog.


# Step 4: Compare Dog Sizes



# üåü Exercise 3 : Who‚Äôs the song producer?
# Goal: Create a Song class to represent song lyrics and print them.



# Key Python Topics:

# Classes and objects
# Object instantiation
# Methods
# Lists


# Instructions:

# Create a Song class with a method to print song lyrics line by line.



# Step 1: Create the Song Class

# Create a class called Song.
# In the __init__ method, take lyrics (a list) as a parameter and create a corresponding attribute.
# Create a sing_me_a_song() method that prints each element of the lyrics list on a new line.


# Example:

# stairway = Song(["There‚Äôs a lady who's sure", "all that glitters is gold", "and she‚Äôs buying a stairway to heaven"]



# üåü Exercise 4 : Afternoon at the Zoo
# Goal:

# Create a Zoo class to manage animals. The class should allow adding animals, displaying them, selling them, and organizing them into alphabetical groups.



# Key Python Topics:

# Classes and objects
# Object instantiation
# Methods
# Lists
# Dictionaries (for grouping)
# String manipulation


# Instructions
# Step 1: Define the Zoo Class
# 1. Create a class called Zoo.

# 2. Implement the __init__() method:

# It takes a string parameter zoo_name, representing the name of the zoo.
# Initialize an empty list called animals to keep track of animal names.
# 3. Add a method add_animal(new_animal):

# This method adds a new animal to the animals list.
# Do not add the animal if it is already in the list.
# 4. Add a method get_animals():

# This method prints all animals currently in the zoo.
# 5. Add a method sell_animal(animal_sold):

# This method checks if a specified animal exists on the animals list and if so, remove from it.
# 6. Add a method sort_animals():

# This method sorts the animals alphabetically.
# It also groups them by the first letter of their name.
# The result should be a dictionary where:
# Each key is a letter.
# Each value is a list of animals that start with that letter.
# Example output:

# {
#    'B': ['Baboon', 'Bear'],
#    'C': ['Cat', 'Cougar'],
#    'G': ['Giraffe'],
#    'L': ['Lion'],
#    'Z': ['Zebra']
# }
# 7. Add a method get_groups():

# This method prints the grouped animals as created by sort_animals().
# Example output:

# B: ['Baboon', 'Bear']
# C: ['Cat', 'Cougar']
# G: ['Giraffe']
# ...


# Step 2: Create a Zoo Object
# Create an instance of the Zoo class and pass a name for the zoo.


# Step 3: Call the Zoo Methods
# Use the methods of your Zoo object to test adding, selling, displaying, sorting, and grouping animals.


# Example (No Internal Logic Provided)
# class Zoo:
#     def __init__(self, zoo_name):
#         pass

#     def add_animal(self, new_animal):
#         pass

#     def get_animals(self):
#         pass

#     def sell_animal(self, animal_sold):
#         pass

#     def sort_animals(self):
#         pass

#     def get_groups(self):
#         pass

# # Step 2: Create a Zoo instance
# brooklyn_safari = Zoo("Brooklyn Safari")

# # Step 3: Use the Zoo methods
# brooklyn_safari.add_animal("Giraffe")
# brooklyn_safari.add_animal("Bear")
# brooklyn_safari.add_animal("Baboon")
# brooklyn_safari.get_animals()
# brooklyn_safari.sell_animal("Bear")
# brooklyn_safari.get_animals()
# brooklyn_safari.sort_animals()
# brooklyn_safari.get_groups()
