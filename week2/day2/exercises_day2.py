describe_city('tel aviv', 'israel')
describe_city('Montreal',)

# 🌟 Exercise 4: Random
# Goal: Create a function that generates random numbers and compares them.
# Key Python Topics:
# random module
# random.randint() function
# Conditional statements (if, else)
# Step 1: Import the random Module
# At the beginning of your script, use import random to access the random number generation functions.
import random
# Step 2: Define a Function with a Parameter
def random_compare(user_number):
# Step 3: Generate a Random Number
    random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
# Inside the function, use random.randint(1, 100) to generate a random integer between 1 and 100.
# Step 4: Compare the Numbers
    if user_number == random_number:
        print(f'Success both numbers are {user_number}')
    else:
        print(f'try again. your number: {user_number}. random number: {random_number}.')
# Step 5: Call the Function
random_compare(1)
# Call the function with a number between 1 and 100.
random_compare(66)

# Expected Output:

# Success! (if the numbers match)
# Fail! Your number: 50, Random number: 23 (if they don't match)


# 🌟 Exercise 5: Let’s Create Some Personalized Shirts!
# Goal: Create a function to describe a shirt’s size and message, with default values.

# Key Python Topics:

# Functions with parameters and default values
# Keyword arguments


# Step 1: Define a Function with Parameters

# Define a function called make_shirt().
# This function should accept two parameters: size and text.


# Step 2: Print a Summary Message

# Set up the function to display a sentence summarizing the shirt’s size and message.


# Step 3: Call the Function



# Step 4: Modify the Function with Default Values

# Modify the make_shirt() function so that size has a default value of “large” and text has a default value of “I love Python”.


# Step 5: Call the Function with Default and Custom Values

# Call make_shirt() to make a large shirt with the default message.
# Call make_shirt() to make a medium shirt with the default message.
# Call make_shirt() to make a shirt of any size with a different message.


# Step 6 (Bonus): Keyword Arguments

# Call make_shirt() using keyword arguments (e.g., make_shirt(size="small", text="Hello!")).


# Expected Output:

# The size of the shirt is large and the text is I love Python.
# The size of the shirt is medium and the text is I love Python.
# The size of the shirt is small and the text is Custom message.


# 🌟 Exercise 6: Magicians…
# Goal: Modify a list of magician names and display them in different ways.

# Key Python Topics:

# Lists
# for loops
# Modifying lists
# Functions that modify data structures


# Step 1: Create a List of Magician Names

# Create a list called magician_names with the given names:
# [‘Harry Houdini’, ‘David Blaine’, ‘Criss Angel’]


# Step 2: Create a Function to Display Magicians

# Create a function called show_magicians() that takes the magician_names list as a parameter.
# Inside the function, iterate through the list and print each magician’s name.


# Step 3: Create a Function to Modify the List

# Create a function called make_great() that takes the magician_names list as a parameter.
# Inside the function, use a for loop to iterate through the list and add “the Great” before each magician’s name.


# Step 4: Call the Functions

# 🌟 Exercise 7: Temperature Advice
# Goal: Generate a random temperature and provide advice based on the temperature range.

# Floating-point numbers (Bonus)
# Handling seasons (Bonus)


# Step 1: Create the get_random_temp() Function

# Create a function called get_random_temp() that returns a random integer between -10 and 40 degrees Celsius.


# Step 2: Create the main() Function

# Create a function called main(). Inside this function:
# Call get_random_temp() to get a random temperature.
# Store the temperature in a variable and print a friendly message like:
# “The temperature right now is 32 degrees Celsius.”


# Step 3: Provide Temperature-Based Advice

# Inside main(), provide advice based on the temperature:
# Below 0°C: e.g., “Brrr, that’s freezing! Wear some extra layers today.”
# Between 0°C and 16°C: e.g., “Quite chilly! Don’t forget your coat.”
# Between 16°C and 23°C: e.g., “Nice weather.”
# Between 24°C and 32°C: e.g., “A bit warm, stay hydrated.”
# Between 32°C and 40°C: e.g., “It’s really hot! Stay cool.”


# Step 4: Floating-Point Temperatures (Bonus)

# Modify get_random_temp() to return a random floating-point number using random.uniform() for more accurate temperature values.


# Step 5: Month-Based Seasons (Bonus)

# Instead of directly generating a random temperature, ask the user for a month (1-12) and determine the season using if/elif conditions.
# Modify get_random_temp() to return temperatures specific to each season.


# Expected Output:

# The temperature right now is 32 degrees Celsius.
# It's really hot! Stay cool.
