# Instructions:

# Create a Text class to analyze text data, either from a string or a file. Then, create a TextModification class to perform text cleaning.



# Part I: Analyzing a Simple String

# Step 1: Create the Text Class

# Create a class called Text.
# The __init__ method should take a string as an argument and store it in an attribute (e.g., self.text).


# Step 2: Implement word_frequency Method

# Create a method called word_frequency(word).
# Split the text attribute into a list of words.
# Count the occurrences of the given word in the list.
# Return the count.
# If the word is not found, return None or a meaningful message.


# Step 3: Implement most_common_word Method

# Create a method called most_common_word().
# Split the text into a list of words.
# Use a dictionary to store word frequencies.
# Find the word with the highest frequency.
# Return the most common word.


# Step 4: Implement unique_words Method

# Create a method called unique_words().
# Split the text into a list of words.
# Use a set to store unique words.
# Return the unique words as a list.


# Part II: Analyzing Text from a File

# Step 5: Implement from_file Class Method

# Create a class method called from_file(file_path).
# Open the file at file_path in read mode.
# Read the file content.
# Create and return a Text instance with the file content as the text.


# Bonus: Text Modification

# Step 6: Create the TextModification Class

# Create a class called TextModification that inherits from Text.


# Step 7: Implement remove_punctuation Method

# Create a method called remove_punctuation().
# Use the string module to get a string of punctuation characters.
# Use a string method or regular expressions to remove punctuation from the text attribute.
# Return the modified text.


# Step 8: Implement remove_stop_words Method

# Create a method called remove_stop_words().
# Search online for a list of English stop words (common words like “a”, “the”, “is”).
# Split the text into a list of words.
# Filter out stop words from the list.
# Join the remaining words back into a string.
# Return the modified text.


# Step 9: Implement remove_special_characters Method

# Create a method called remove_special_characters().
# Use regular expressions to remove special characters from the text attribute.
# Return the modified text.
