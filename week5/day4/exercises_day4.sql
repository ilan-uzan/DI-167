-- If you get errors:
-- If you receive a ‚ÄúUtility not found‚Äù Error, you need to change pgadmin binary path. Check out this video

-- If you receive an error of binary path :
-- Go to your computer documents -> C: (on windows) -> Program Files -> PostgreSQL -> your version -> bin. Copy this path, it should be something like this : C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\bin.
