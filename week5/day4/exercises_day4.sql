-- 🌟 Exercise 1 : Items and customers
-- Instructions
-- We will work on the public database that we created yesterday.

-- Use SQL to get the following from the database:
-- All items, ordered by price (lowest to highest).
-- Items with a price above 80 (80 included), ordered by price (highest to lowest).
-- The first 3 customers in alphabetical order of the first name (A-Z) – exclude the primary key column from the results.
-- All last names (no other columns!), in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A)


-- 🌟 Exercise 2 : dvdrental database
-- Instructions
-- Setup
-- We will install a new sample database on our PostgreSQL servers.
-- Download this sample database file

-- There is a single file called dvdrental.tar inside the zip. Extract it to your local directory.
-- Tip : If you are using Mac, after extracting the zip file you will get a folder called dvdrental

-- Go to pgAdmin4, and navigate to Databases on the left panel.

-- Right click > Create > Database…

-- Type in the name of the new database: dvdrental, and click Save. Wait a few moments.

-- Right click on dvdrental under Databases in the left panel.

-- Click Restore….

-- For PC users choose the following format Custom or tar. For Mac Users, choose the following format Directory.

-- Next to Filename, you should see a button with 3 dots on it. Click the button.

-- For PC users: “Find your file in the window”. For Max users: “Find your folder in the window”. (you may have to check Show hidden files and folders?), and click the Select button.


-- If you get errors:
-- If you receive a “Utility not found” Error, you need to change pgadmin binary path. Check out this video

-- If you receive an error of binary path :
-- Go to your computer documents -> C: (on windows) -> Program Files -> PostgreSQL -> your version -> bin. Copy this path, it should be something like this : C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\bin.
-- In pgAdmin select File -> Preferences -> Path -> Binary Path -> scroll down to PostgreSQL Binary Path -> Find your PostgreSQL version -> paste the path -> Save

-- If you see any other error messages, please save them and get assistance. If not, you should have a new database loaded into your server!
-- If you have a problem importing the database, here are the DEFAULT instructions


-- Diagram of the tables
-- Here is a diagram of the tables in the server. Take a look at it and learn about the tables, their columns, and the relationships between the different tables.
