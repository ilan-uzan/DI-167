# 🌟 Exercise 1: Converting Lists into Dictionaries
# Key Python Topics:

# Creating dictionaries
# Zip function or dictionary comprehension


# Instructions

# You are given two lists. Convert them into a dictionary where the first list contains the keys and the second list contains the corresponding values.



# Lists:

keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
values = [10, 20, 30]

#concatenatw the lists

new_list = zip(keys, values)
print(list(new_list))

#convert the list into a dictionary
my_dict = dict(zip(keys, values))
print(my_dict)

# Expected Output:

# {'Ten': 10, 'Twenty': 20, 'Thirty': 30}


# 🌟 Exercise 2: Cinemax #2
# Key Python Topics:

# Looping through dictionaries
# Conditionals
# Calculations


# Instructions

# Write a program that calculates the total cost of movie tickets for a family based on their ages.

# Family members’ ages are stored in a dictionary.
# The ticket pricing rules are as follows:
# Under 3 years old: Free
# 3 to 12 years old: $10
# Over 12 years old: $15


# Family Data:

# family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}


# Loop through the family dictionary to calculate the total cost.
# Print the ticket price for each family member.
# Print the total cost at the end.


# Bonus:

# Allow the user to input family members’ names and ages, then calculate the total ticket cost.



# 🌟 Exercise 3: Zara
# Key Python Topics:

# Creating dictionaries
# Accessing and modifying dictionary elements
# Dictionary methods like .pop() and .update()


# Instructions

# Create and manipulate a dictionary that contains information about the Zara brand.



# Brand Information:

# name: Zara
# creation_date: 1975
# creator_name: Amancio Ortega Gaona
# type_of_clothes: men, women, children, home
# international_competitors: Gap, H&M, Benetton
# number_stores: 7000
# major_color: 
#     France: blue, 
#     Spain: red, 
#     US: pink, green


# Create a dictionary called brand with the provided data.
# Modify and access the dictionary as follows:
# Change the value of number_stores to 2.
# Print a sentence describing Zara’s clients using the type_of_clothes key.
# Add a new key country_creation with the value Spain.
# Check if international_competitors exists and, if so, add “Desigual” to the list.
# Delete the creation_date key.
# Print the last item in international_competitors.
# Print the major colors in the US.
# Print the number of keys in the dictionary.
# Print all keys of the dictionary.


# Bonus:

# Create another dictionary called more_on_zara with creation_date and number_stores. Merge this dictionary with the original brand dictionary and print the result.



# 🌟 Exercise 4: Disney Characters
# Key Python Topics:

# Looping with indexes
# Dictionary creation
# Sorting


# Instructions

# You are given a list of Disney characters. Create three dictionaries based on different patterns as shown below:



# Character List:

# users = ["Mickey", "Minnie", "Donald", "Ariel", "Pluto"]


# Expected Results:

# 1. Create a dictionary that maps characters to their indices:

# {"Mickey": 0, "Minnie": 1, "Donald": 2, "Ariel": 3, "Pluto": 4}


# 2. Create a dictionary that maps indices to characters:

# {0: "Mickey", 1: "Minnie", 2: "Donald", 3: "Ariel", 4: "Pluto"}


# 3. Create a dictionary where characters are sorted alphabetically and mapped to their indices:

# {"Ariel": 0, "Donald": 1, "Mickey": 2, "Minnie": 3, "Pluto": 4}
